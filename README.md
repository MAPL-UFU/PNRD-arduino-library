**Arduino libraries for creating PNRD and IPNRD applications**


## PetriNet

The PetriNet library  was built based on the PetriNet class.
With this class we create a mathematical model of a PN


## PN532
This is an Arduino library for PN532 to use NFC technology. 
[Adafruit_NFCShield_I2C](http://goo.gl/pk3FdB)
, improved by [Seeed Studio](http://goo.gl/zh1iQh), added HSU(High Speed Uart) driver by [Elechouse](http://elechouse.com). 


## Pn532NfcReader
The PN532NFcReader library reads and writes the tags using the PN532 library and reader with the NDEF(NFC Exchange Format) format.

## Pnrd 

The PNRD library  was built based on the Pnrd class. This class is a child of the PetriNet class and inherits its public methods.
